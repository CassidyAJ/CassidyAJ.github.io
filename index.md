### Welcome to my website! 

##### About me: I am a college student at the University of the Pacific studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I\'m particularly passionate about cyber security and data science, but always looking to broaden my horizons. I\'ll be writing about various interests on this site, not all of which will be computer science related\! I like to talk about education, my faith, hobbies, jokes, and much more. Checkout out my blog to learn more about me\!
